## Introduction

- Using the mtcars dataset we plot in an attempt to understand the relationship of various factors to gas mileage (mpg).

- We plot weight (wt) vs. mileage (mpg) spatially along the x/y axes. We visualize the number of cylinders (cyl) as colors and the amount of horsepower (hp) as the size of an individual point in the plot.

## Visualizing the Data

```{r}
suppressWarnings(suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly)))
suppressWarnings(suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(bindrcpp)))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data")
```
